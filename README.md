## Workflow
Using AGILE methodology 

### Requirements gathering flow
Look at the problem as a team, get the requirements.
Document the functional and non-functional requirements down under Teams Word doc. 

### Sprints - TBC on Assignment release
1 sprint is every 2 weeks. Minimum 1 weekly update session date 

### Backlog issues creation flow
Create user stories from the requirements.
Create the issues from the user stories.
Rank the issues for AGILE on https://planningpokeronline.com/
Number is to identify how difficult an issue is. 1 - very easy, 13 - Very Hard
Priority is set based on dependency. Urgent - A lot of functions depend on this case. Medium - little to no functions depend on it.

### Git usage strategy
#### Branch & Pull Requests
Naming Sense -> Action keyword + function name e.g. Create_hello_world
No Spaces, replaced with "_"

Pull Request - Everyone can create a pull request.
A pull request can only be approved by Elgin (Lead Dev) or Optional,Kevin (Scrum Master).

### Change requirement strategy
Identify new requirements or adjust existing requirements. 
Amend Requirements document.
All user stories and issues relating to old requirements that will be changed is to be removed.
Create new user stories and issues.
Rank new issues.
Amend burn up or burn down chart etc.

### Deployment strategy
How the code should be pushed out.

1 Live version (PROD)
1 Testing version (UAT)

Develop the code on UAT, test it on UAT. Code is developed in a modular fashion.
Only when all okay on UAT push to live. 
Minimal pushes to live branch. No bug fixes allowed on live branch only roll backs if major error was discovered.

### Communications Strategy
Communications will be via teams for calling. Usage of telegram for text communication.
